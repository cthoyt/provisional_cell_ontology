# Provisional cell ontology

An experiment in data-driven cell ontology development - provisional cell type terms, generated from [ROBOT templates](https://github.com/obophenotype/provisional_cell_ontology/tree/master/src/robot_templates)

WARNING: The contents of this repo are currently experimental.  IDs may not be stable and definitions may not be reliable!

This ontology is intended as a place for provisional cell type definitions derived from data (and from scRNAseq in particular).

## A note on editing

All terms in this ontology are generated using ROBOT templates.  Any edits to pcl-edit.owl will be overwritten.
